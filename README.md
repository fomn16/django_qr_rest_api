A small API with authentication that generates QR codes for users, saves them as images on the local disk, and manages deletion and related tasks.
A Docker image is available at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fomn/django_qr_rest_api/general

In the docker image there are two users already created for testing, each with one already created QR code:


username: admin

password: password


username: test

password: testpassword
